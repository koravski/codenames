  "rules-classic-grid": `Twenty-five word cards are randomly laid out in a grid. A number of these words represent <1>red</1> agents, a number represent <3>blue</3> agents, one represents an <5>assassin</5>, and the others represent <7>innocent bystanders</span>. The teams' spymasters know the colors of each word, and take turns to hint their team for them to find the words of their color.`,
  "rules-classic-hints": `Each hint may only consist of one single word and a number of cards it relates to. The spymaster gives a hint that is related to as many of the words on his/her own agents' cards as possible, but not to any others ‚Äì they might accidentally lead their team to choose a card representing an innocent bystander, an opposing agent, or the assassin.`,
  "rules-hint-restrictions": `The hint's word can be chosen freely, as long as it is not (and does not contain) any of the words on the code name cards still showing at that time. Phonetic clues are typically forbidden.`,
  "rules-turns":
    "The cards are revealed as guesses are made. Field operatives must make at least one guess per turn, risking a wrong guess and its consequences. They may also end their turn voluntarily at any point thereafter. They can guess up to the number given by the spymaster, plus one (a bonus to find a previously hinted word).",
  "rules-classic-game-end": `The game ends when all of one team's agents are identified (üèÖ), or when one team has identified the <1>assassin</1> (‚ò†Ô∏è).`,
  "rules-duet-objective": `Two players cooperate to find 15 words on the board.`,
  "rules-duet-grid": `Twenty-five word cards are randomly laid out in a grid. A number of these words represent <1>green</1> agents, a number represent <3>assassins</3>, and the others represent <5>innocent bystanders</5>. Each player knows 9 <7>green</7> words, some of them overlapping with the other side.`,
  "rules-duet-hints": `Players alternatively give hints to make the other player find their green cards. Each hint may only consist of one single word and a number of cards it relates to. The spymaster gives a hint that is related to as many of the words on his/her own agents' cards as possible, but not to any others ‚Äì they might accidentally lead the other player to choose a card representing an innocent bystander, or an assassin.`,
  "rules-duet-game-end": `The game ends when all of the 15 green agents are identified (üèÖ), or when one player has identified an <1>assassin</1> (‚ò†Ô∏è). The game is timed, which means that players get a total of 9 turns to find all the words. Clicking on an <3>innocent bystander</span> consumes one extra turn.`,
